## Properties
* Built with Html, CSS and JavaScript
* Uses [Longest Common Subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) algoritm to find and keep track of differences between two strings.

## Limitations
* Has a word level accuracy.
* Compares input text's sentence to sentence and therefore only accepts same number of sentences in bot inputs.
